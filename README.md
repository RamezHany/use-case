# Project Report Guide  

## 📌 Introduction  
This guide explains how to create a `report.md` file to document bugs and tasks in a structured way. A good report should include:  

1. **Summary** – A brief overview of the report.  
2. **Bugs Report** – Detailed descriptions of bugs, how to reproduce them, and solutions.  
3. **Tasks Report** – A list of completed and ongoing tasks with time tracking.  
4. **Summary & Next Steps** – Additional notes and future actions.

### 2️⃣ **Bugs Report**  

Each bug should be documented with the following details:  

- **Description** – What the bug is.  
- **Steps to Reproduce** – How to replicate the issue.  
- **Expected Result** – What should happen.  
- **Actual Result** – What actually happens.  
- **Fix Status** – Fixed / In Progress / Not Fixed.  
- **Time Taken** – Time spent solving the issue.  
- **Root Cause** – The reason behind the issue.  
- **Solution** – How the issue was resolved.  
- **Notes** – Any additional insights.  

#### 📍 Example Bug Report: Image Not Loading Issue  

**Bug:** Images are not displaying on the website.  

**Steps to Reproduce:**  
1. Open the page containing images.  
2. Try uploading a new image via the admin panel.  
3. The image does not appear, and an error message is logged in the console.  

**Expected Result:**  
Uploaded images should be displayed correctly on the website.  

**Actual Result:**  
Images are not loading, and debugging shows an incorrect data format.  

**Fix Status:** ✅ Fixed  

**Time Taken:** ⏳ 3 hours  

**Root Cause:**  
- The frontend was sending images in `base64` format, while the backend expected `multipart/form-data`.  
- The image path was incorrect, preventing the server from finding the images.  

**Solution:**  
✔ Updated the form to send images using `FormData` instead of `base64`.  
✔ Ensured the request `Content-Type` is `multipart/form-data`.  
✔ Fixed the image path in the backend to match the expected storage location.  

**Notes:**  
- The issue was resolved and tested across different environments.  
- Always check `Network Requests` in DevTools to debug file uploads.  
- The API documentation should be updated to clarify the correct image upload process.
